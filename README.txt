### The 3D Heat Equation

on is not met
4.2 Analysis
Along with your assignment, you must the submit the following:
1. A strong scaling study for a large problem, including a graph and explanation


2. A weak scaling study for a large problem, including a graph and explanation
3. A graph of mean temperature with standard deviation vs. time for a large problem.
4. A 2D animation of temperature vs. time for a problem run in parallel. This can be significantly smaller than the problems simulated in the other analyses. You can either submit a graphic file (an MPEG, a GIF, etc) or a script that runs an animation from some output that you also submit.
